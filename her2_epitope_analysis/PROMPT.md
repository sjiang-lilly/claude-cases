# HER2 Epitope Analysis for ADC Binder Design

## Prompt

I want to know the epitopes in HER2 for binder design for ADCs.

### To-do list:
1. List epitopes on HER2 and label out which epitope has mAbs for HER2 ADCs. Evaluate which epitope is better for mAb design.
2. Predict how different epitope will affect internalization after binding
3. Summarize these mAbs features, binding epitopes, provide the image of docking between binder and epitope into one table.
4. Predict better mAbs for HER2 epitopes.
5. HER2 ADC could cause resistance due to mutations on epitopes or HER2 decreased, make a scientific plan to overcome this.
6. Wrap up these into a report, which can be a word or pdf document since I asked for the docking image. Also include what skills being used, and dependencies or packages being used. Output md files for this project and wrap up the prompt into a md file.
