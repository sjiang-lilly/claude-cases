## HER2 ADC Resistance Mechanisms

### 1. Target-Related Resistance

| Mechanism | Frequency | Impact | Solution |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| HER2 downregulation | 15-30% | Loss of target | Bispecific ADCs, combination therapy |
| p95-HER2 truncation | 20-30% | No ECD binding | TKIs, intracellular targeting |
| Epitope mutations | <2% | Reduced binding | Alternative epitope targeting |
| HER2 splice variants | 5% | Variable | Epitope mapping, bispecifics |

### 2. Drug Resistance Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Affected ADCs | Solution |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| MDR1/P-gp efflux | T-DM1, Disitamab | T-DXd (not P-gp substrate) |
| Altered lysosomal pH | All ADCs | Linker optimization |
| Payload metabolism | All ADCs | Novel payloads |
| DNA repair upregulation | T-DXd | Combination with PARP inhibitors |

### 3. Tumor Microenvironment

| Factor | Effect | Strategy |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Hypoxia | Reduced efficacy | Hypoxia-activated prodrugs |
| Stromal barriers | Poor penetration | Smaller formats, bispecifics |
| Immune suppression | Reduced ADCC | Fc optimization, immunotherapy |

### 4. Key Clinical Observations

**T-DM1 Resistance:**
- MDR1 upregulation common
- HER2 downregulation
- Lysosomal drug sequestration

**T-DXd Advantages:**
- Bystander effect (works with heterogeneous HER2)
- Not MDR1 substrate
- Higher DAR compensates for lower HER2

**Bispecific ADC Potential:**
- Zanidatamab-based ADCs in development
- Target multiple epitopes
- Enhanced internalization overcomes slow uptake
