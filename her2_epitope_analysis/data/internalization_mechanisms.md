## HER2 Internalization Mechanisms

### 1. Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis (CME)
- Primary pathway for HER2 internalization
- Requires receptor clustering/activation
- Leads to early endosome → late endosome → lysosome
- T1/2 for CME: 5-15 minutes (initial step)

### 2. Receptor Recycling
- HER2 undergoes significant recycling (unlike EGFR)
- Recycling reduces effective ADC delivery
- Key factor: recycling rate inversely correlates with ADC efficacy

### 3. Factors Affecting Internalization

| Factor | Effect on Internalization | ADC Impact |
|--------|--------------------------|------------|
| Receptor clustering | ↑↑ Internalization | Positive |
| Dimerization blocking | ↓ Internalization | Negative |
| Lipid raft association | ↑ Internalization | Positive |
| HSP90 binding | Stabilizes surface HER2 | Negative |
| Cross-linking | ↑↑↑ Internalization | Very Positive |

### 4. Epitope-Specific Effects

**Domain IV (Trastuzumab):**
- Moderate internalization (~25% at 4h)
- Significant recycling (60-70%)
- Does not block dimerization
- Proven ADC efficacy despite slow uptake

**Domain II (Pertuzumab):**
- Slow internalization (~15% at 4h)
- High recycling (80%)
- Blocks HER2-HER3 dimerization
- NOT suitable for ADC alone

**Biparatopic (Zanidatamab):**
- Rapid internalization (~70% at 4h)
- Minimal recycling (20%)
- Induces receptor clustering
- OPTIMAL for ADC design

### 5. ADC Design Recommendations

For optimal ADC efficacy based on internalization:

1. **Best**: Biparatopic antibodies targeting Domain II + IV
   - Zanidatamab-based ADC (ZW49 in development)
   - Enhanced clustering and internalization

2. **Good**: Domain IV with high DAR
   - T-DXd (DAR 8) compensates for slower uptake
   - Bystander effect enhances tumor killing

3. **Moderate**: Domain IV with optimized linker
   - Cleavable linkers (T-DXd) > Non-cleavable (T-DM1)
   - Consider combination approaches

4. **Not Recommended**: Domain II alone
   - Use for signaling blockade, not ADC
